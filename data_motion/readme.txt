Dataset is delimited as CSV values as follows:

X ; Y; Z; Pressure; GripAngle; Timestamp; Test ID

<---------------->

X; Y; Z:
Spatial coordinates that the pen traced to draw the spiral on top of a plane

Pressure:
Pressure applied with the pen by the patient while drawing the spiral

GripAngle:
Angle of the patient's hand in relation to the pen when holding it

Timstamp:
***

Test ID: 
0: Static Spiral Test (Draw on the given spiral pattern)
1: Dynamic Spiral Test (Spiral pattern will blink in a certain time, so subjects need to continue on their draw)
2: Circular Motion Test (Subjectd draw circles around the red point)
